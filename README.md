## Introduction

Welcome to the Pinterest Experiment Analytics Data Pipeline Project! This project is designed to simulate the data processing pipeline used by Pinterest to analyze experiment data. The pipeline runs on AWS Cloud and processes billions of data points daily to provide valuable insights for improving Pinterest's product.

### What It Does

The project builds a data pipeline that extracts experiment data, processes it, and provides insights. The system uses AWS MSK (Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka) for data streaming and integrates with IAM for secure access.

### Aim of the Project

- **Simulate Pinterest's Data Pipeline:** Build a data pipeline that processes and analyzes experiment data.
- **Leverage AWS Services:** Use AWS MSK, IAM, and other AWS services to handle data streaming and processing.
- **Provide Insights:** Analyze the processed data to extract insights that can help improve the product.

### What I Learned

- Setting up and configuring AWS MSK.
- Using IAM for secure authentication and access control.
- Building and managing a data pipeline using Apache Kafka.
- Processing large datasets to extract meaningful insights.

## Features

- **Data Streaming:** Utilizes AWS MSK for reliable data streaming.
- **Secure Access:** Configures IAM for secure access and authentication.
- **Data Processing:** Processes large volumes of data to provide insights.
- **Automated Pipeline:** Automates the data extraction, processing, and analysis workflow.
